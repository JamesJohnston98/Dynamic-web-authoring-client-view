<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>Outside of University I am interested in Motorsport. More sepcifically the motorsport of Rallying. This is because i have grown up around this as there are members of our family who are involved within the motorsport. This is because i have attended many different events over the years.</p>
<p>I am also a member of Ardarragh Accordion Band from Rathfriland. This is enjoyable as it is a good way to socialise and make new friends and it also means that you can travel to many different part of the country.</p>
